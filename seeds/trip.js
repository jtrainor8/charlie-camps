        Description: "This city-run campground was a real find. You could stay up to three days for free, and it was worth every moment. A lovely stream flowed by the sites, and there were trails to explore the canyon. It was a cool oasis in the desert, a welcome relief from the heat. We were surprised to see birch trees out west, a rare sight for us. Despite the place being crowded with Mormon crickets, it was still beautiful. We always aim to stay here when we're in the area.",
